# CGGT
Cube Geometry Generating Tool (CGGT)

NOTE: if you want to do resetting/local vs. global transforms, must change lines 21 and 23 in cubicstylization.cpp to correct file path. 
You must also change project properties (C/C++->General->Additional Include Directories) to include your igl include path and eigen include path.
